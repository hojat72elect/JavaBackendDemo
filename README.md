## Jave Backend demo

This repository is a collection of all the Java backend technologies I have worked with so far:

<ol>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></li>

The class [DbFunctions.kt] contains all the elementary operations that you can do on a SQL database via PostgreSQL.

I have created that class with help of [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vVAYYSRbD2zL7o_TBPnVAgBZmg6f4JA)
youtube tutorial.

The written code is pretty generic to any SQL database; but we have connected it to a PostgreSQL driver.


<s><li><strong>JavaFX + SQLite</strong></li>

The code inside `school_system` is a demo SQLite database with a frontend written in JavaFX.

The tutorial I'm following for this one is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1rYlMrvNyE).
